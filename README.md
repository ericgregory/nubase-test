# Demo: Wasm Native Database API with Couchbase (and Secrets)

This demo is a light adaptation of the demo from the [WasmCon 2024 workshop](https://github.com/vados-cosmonic/wasmcon2024-couchbase-workshop) by [Victor Adossi](https://github.com/vados-cosmonic) and [Laurent Doguin](https://github.com/ldoguin). This version uses secrets and a NATS-based secrets backend when deploying the application.
